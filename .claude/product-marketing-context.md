# GymGurus — Product Marketing Context

## Product
**GymGurus** — AI-powered fitness management platform for personal trainers and solo fitness enthusiasts.

## Primary Audience
Independent personal trainers managing 5–50 clients.
- Pain points: juggling spreadsheets, losing clients to bigger apps, no AI assistance, paying $100+/mo for clunky software
- Jobs to be done: assign workout plans, track client progress, communicate with clients, grow their business
- Tech comfort: moderate — they want "it just works," not a dev tool

## Secondary Audience
Solo fitness enthusiasts tracking their own progress.
- Pain points: generic fitness apps, no personalized AI coaching, scattered data across multiple apps
- Jobs to be done: log workouts, track body metrics, get AI-powered guidance, earn achievements
- Tech comfort: high — comfortable with mobile/web apps
