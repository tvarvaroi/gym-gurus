## 1. Content Pillars

Every piece of content maps to one of four pillars. This ensures a balanced content mix that serves SEO, audience education, product awareness, and industry authority simultaneously.

### Pillar 1: Fitness Science

**Theme:** Calculator content, exercise science, research-backed training information.
**Purpose:** Drive organic traffic through high-volume fitness search queries. Position GymGurus as a credible, science-first platform.
**Target Audience:** Fitness enthusiasts (solo users), trainers looking for client resources, athletes researching training methods.
**Content Types:** Blog articles, calculator guides, infographics, social media explainers.
**Tone:** Educational, precise, evidence-based. Cite studies and formulas. Avoid bro-science.

**Example Topics:**

- How to calculate TDEE accurately (and why most calculators get it wrong)
- The science behind 1RM estimation: Epley vs. Brzycki vs. Lombardi
- Body fat percentage vs. BMI: which metric actually matters for health?
- Heart rate zone training: when to use it and when to ignore it
- Strength standards by age, weight, and training experience

**Internal Linking Strategy:** Every Fitness Science article links to the relevant GymGurus calculator page. Every calculator page links back to related blog articles. This creates a content cluster that strengthens SEO authority for calculator-related keywords.

---

### Pillar 2: Trainer Business

**Theme:** Growing a personal training business, managing clients, pricing, admin efficiency, career development.
**Purpose:** Attract personal trainers searching for business advice. Build trust and authority before introducing the product. Drive signups from trainers who discover GymGurus through educational content.
**Target Audience:** Independent personal trainers (primary buyer persona), fitness coaches, online coaches.
**Content Types:** Blog articles, case studies, templates, LinkedIn posts, email sequences.
**Tone:** Practical, empathetic, peer-to-peer. Speak as a fellow professional who understands the grind of running a training business.

**Example Topics:**

- How to price your personal training services in 2026
- Client retention strategies that actually work for independent trainers
- How to manage 30+ clients without burning out
- The real cost of running a personal training business (with spreadsheet template)
- How to onboard a new client in 15 minutes (process template)

**Internal Linking Strategy:** Trainer Business articles link to GymGurus features that solve the discussed problem (e.g., "managing 30+ clients" links to the client management dashboard; "client retention" links to gamification features). Include a contextual CTA in each article, not just a generic footer CTA.

---

### Pillar 3: AI & Technology

**Theme:** How AI is transforming personal training, industry trends, technology adoption in fitness.
**Purpose:** Establish GymGurus as the thought leader at the intersection of AI and fitness. Attract early-adopter trainers and tech-savvy fitness professionals. Capture emerging search queries around AI fitness tools.
**Target Audience:** Tech-forward trainers, fitness industry professionals, AI/tech enthusiasts interested in fitness.
**Content Types:** Blog articles, trend reports, social media thought leadership, webinars, video content.
**Tone:** Forward-looking, authoritative, accessible. Explain AI concepts simply without being condescending.

**Example Topics:**

- How AI is changing personal training in 2026
- Can an AI coach replace a personal trainer? (honest analysis)
- 5 ways trainers can use AI to scale their business today
- The future of fitness technology: trends to watch
- AI-generated workout programs: how good are they really?

**Internal Linking Strategy:** AI & Technology articles link to the GymGurus AI Coach feature page and the `/lp/ai-coach` landing page. Position GymGurus as the practical implementation of the trends discussed.

---

### Pillar 4: Product Features

**Theme:** GymGurus tutorials, feature walkthroughs, tips and tricks, update announcements.
**Purpose:** Educate existing users, reduce churn, drive feature adoption, and provide social proof to prospects researching the platform.
**Target Audience:** Existing GymGurus users (retention), prospects evaluating the platform (conversion).
**Content Types:** Tutorial blog posts, video walkthroughs, changelog posts, comparison pages, help docs.

### Keyword-to-Content Mapping

Every blog article targets a primary keyword and 2-3 secondary keywords. This prevents keyword cannibalization (multiple pages competing for the same keyword) and ensures comprehensive coverage.

- **TikTok:** Discovery platform. Post native, authentic content -- not repurposed Instagram content. Use trending formats and sounds. Calculator demos and "day in the life of a trainer" content perform well.
- **Twitter/X:** Engagement and conversation platform. Threads for educational content. Polls for engagement. Quote-tweet relevant fitness industry conversations.
- **YouTube:** Long-form home. Upload webinar recordings, full tutorials, and extended calculator walkthroughs. YouTube Shorts for repurposed TikTok/Reel content.

## 6. Distribution Strategy

### Platform-by-Platform Strategy

#### LinkedIn

**Role:** Primary professional content channel. Where trainers discover GymGurus through thought leadership and business insights.
**Content Types:** Text posts (with 1 image), article shares, PDF carousels, polls, video posts.
**Posting Frequency:** 3-5 times per week.
**Tone:** Professional, insightful, first-person. Share genuine learnings, not corporate messaging.

**Content Categories:**

1. Trainer business tips (pricing, client management, growth strategies)
2. AI and fitness technology insights
3. Blog article promotions (with a native text hook, not just a link)
4. Behind-the-scenes of building GymGurus (founder journey, product decisions)
5. Industry conversations and commentary

**Best Practices:**

- Write the first 3 lines as a hook (text is truncated after 3 lines on LinkedIn)
- Use line breaks for readability
- Include 3-5 relevant hashtags: #PersonalTraining #FitnessCoach #FitnessTech #AIFitness #GymGurus
- Tag relevant people or companies when contextually appropriate
- Respond to every comment within 4 hours

**Sample Post (Trainer Business Pillar):**

```
Most personal trainers undercharge by 30-40%.

Here's the pricing math nobody talks about:

Your hourly session rate is NOT your hourly income.

Factor in:
- Client programming time (30-60 min/client/week)
- Client messaging time (15-30 min/client/week)
- Admin time (scheduling, billing, tracking)
- Marketing time (social media, outreach, content)
- Continuing education
- Taxes and insurance

That $60/hour session? Your real hourly rate is closer to $25.

#### Instagram

**Role:** Primary visual and community platform. Builds brand awareness through calculator content, product visuals, and trainer success stories.
**Content Types:** Carousel posts, Reels, Stories, single images.
**Posting Frequency:** 5-7 times per week (posts + stories).
**Tone:** Visual-first, educational, aspirational. Dark premium aesthetic with Electric Blue (#3B82F6) and Emerald (#10B981) accents.

**Content Categories:**

1. Calculator graphics (infographics explaining how to interpret results)
2. Product screenshots (dashboard, AI coach, gamification)
3. Reels (calculator demos, quick tips, trending formats)
4. Trainer testimonials (quote graphics)
5. Stories: polls, questions, behind-the-scenes, quick tips

**Visual Brand Guidelines:**

- Background: Dark (#0F172A or #1E293B)
- Primary accent: Electric Blue (#3B82F6) for headlines, buttons, highlights
- Secondary accent: Emerald (#10B981) for CTAs, success states, positive metrics
- Text: White (#FFFFFF) for body text, Light Gray (#94A3B8) for secondary text
- Font style: Clean, modern sans-serif (match the app UI)
- All graphics should feel like they belong in the GymGurus app

**Instagram Bio:**

```
GymGurus | AI-Powered Fitness Platform
Manage clients. AI coach. 12 free calculators.
Built for independent trainers.
Free trial -- link below
[link to /lp/trainer or Linktree]
```

---

#### TikTok

**Role:** Discovery platform for reaching trainers and fitness enthusiasts who are not yet searching for software. TikTok's algorithm surfaces content to new audiences regardless of follower count.
**Content Types:** Short-form video (15-60 seconds), vertical format.
**Posting Frequency:** 3-5 times per week.
**Tone:** Authentic, quick, slightly informal. Native to the platform -- not repurposed polished content.

**Content Categories:**

1. Calculator demos ("Calculate your 1RM in 10 seconds")
2. AI coach reactions ("I let AI answer my clients' questions for a day")
3. Trainer life content ("POV: Your client cancels 10 minutes before their session")
4. Quick tips ("3 things I do in every client onboarding")
5. Trending format adaptations (adapt trending sounds/formats to fitness training context)

**TikTok-Specific Best Practices:**

- First 1-2 seconds determine whether users stop scrolling. Open with text on screen, a surprising statement, or direct eye contact.
- Use native TikTok text overlays and captions (not pre-burned graphics).
- Post at peak times: 7-9 AM and 5-7 PM in target time zones.
- Engage with comments immediately after posting (first hour is critical for algorithm boost).
- Use 3-5 hashtags: #PersonalTrainer #FitnessCoach #FitTok #GymGurus #AICoach

---

#### YouTube

**Role:** Long-form content library. Houses tutorials, webinars, full product walkthroughs, and educational deep-dives. YouTube content has the longest shelf life of any platform and compounds SEO value over time.
**Content Types:** Long-form tutorials (5-15 min), webinar recordings (30-45 min), YouTube Shorts (15-60 sec).
**Posting Frequency:** 1-2 long-form videos per month + 3-4 Shorts per week (repurposed from TikTok/Reels).
**Tone:** Educational, thorough, professional but personable.

**Content Categories:**

1. Product tutorials ("Getting Started with GymGurus: Complete Walkthrough")
2. Calculator tutorials ("How to Use the TDEE Calculator for Client Programming")
3. Webinar recordings (with timestamps and chapters)
4. YouTube Shorts (repurposed TikTok/Reel content, adapted for YouTube's algorithm)
5. Industry discussion ("Is AI Going to Replace Personal Trainers? Honest Take")

**YouTube SEO Notes:**

- Title: Include primary keyword in the first 60 characters
- Description: 200+ words, include primary and secondary keywords naturally, link to relevant GymGurus pages, include timestamps
- Tags: 10-15 relevant tags including brand name, competitor names, and keyword variants
- Thumbnail: Custom thumbnail with large, readable text. Dark background. Face close-up for talking-head videos. Calculator screenshot for tutorial videos.
- Chapters: Add timestamp chapters for videos over 5 minutes. YouTube uses chapters for featured snippets and search ranking.

### Cross-Platform Content Repurposing Framework

One piece of core content (a blog article or video) generates 8-12 distribution pieces across platforms. This maximizes reach without requiring 8-12 unique creation efforts.

**Example: Blog Article "How to Calculate TDEE for Your Clients"**

| #   | Derivative Content                               | Platform       | Format              | Effort                  |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1   | Original blog article (2,500 words)              | Website / Blog | Long-form article   | High (core content)     |
| 2   | LinkedIn text post with key insight              | LinkedIn       | Text + image        | Low (excerpt + rewrite) |
| 3   | Instagram carousel: "3 TDEE Formulas Explained"  | Instagram      | Carousel (5 slides) | Medium (design)         |
| 4   | TikTok: "Calculate your TDEE in 15 seconds"      | TikTok         | 30-sec video        | Medium (filming)        |
| 5   | Instagram Reel: same as TikTok, adapted          | Instagram      | Reel                | Low (repurpose TikTok)  |
| 6   | YouTube Short: same content, adapted             | YouTube        | Short               | Low (repurpose TikTok)  |
| 7   | Twitter thread: "How to calculate TDEE (thread)" | Twitter/X      | Thread (5 tweets)   | Low (excerpt)           |
| 8   | Email newsletter segment                         | Email          | Newsletter block    | Low (excerpt + link)    |
| 9   | Instagram Story: poll + calculator link          | Instagram      | Story (3 frames)    | Low                     |
| 10  | Pinterest infographic: TDEE formula breakdown    | Pinterest      | Infographic         | Medium (design)         |

**Repurposing Rule:** Create the blog article first (highest effort, highest SEO value), then derive all other formats from it. Never create social content that doesn't trace back to a core content piece.

**Review Process:**

1. Outline created and approved (Day 1)
2. First draft written (Day 3-5)
3. Editorial review: accuracy, SEO, internal linking, CTA placement (Day 5-6)
