## 1. Google Ads Strategy

Google Ads is the highest-intent paid channel for GymGurus. Trainers actively searching for software solutions are the closest to a buying decision. Calculator-related searches provide a massive top-of-funnel opportunity at low cost.

### 1.1 Search Campaign: Personal Trainer Software Keywords

**Campaign Name:** `google_search_trainer-software`
**Objective:** Capture high-intent trainers actively searching for client management and training software.
**Match Types:** Phrase match and exact match only (no broad match in Phase 1 to control spend).
**Landing Page:** `/lp/trainer`

### 1.2 Search Campaign: Calculator Traffic Capture

**Campaign Name:** `google_search_calculator-keywords`

**Strategy Notes:**

- These keywords have enormous volume but low commercial intent. The goal is NOT direct paid conversions -- it is brand awareness, email capture, and remarketing pool building.
- Bid conservatively ($0.20 - $0.50 actual CPC target). Do not compete with health sites for top position on "BMI calculator."
- Focus budget on mid-volume, low-competition terms: "TDEE calculator," "1RM calculator," "strength standards calculator," "FFMI calculator," and "wilks score calculator." These attract a more fitness-literate audience that overlaps with our trainer persona.
- Each calculator page should include a soft CTA: "Are you a personal trainer? GymGurus gives your clients access to all 12 calculators + AI coaching."

**Ad Copy (Calculator Campaign):**

**Ad 1 — BMI / General:**

- Headline 1: `Free BMI Calculator -- Instant Results`
- Headline 2: `12 Pro Fitness Calculators -- All Free`
- Headline 3: `No Signup Required`
- Description: `Calculate BMI, TDEE, 1RM, macros, body fat, and more. Clean, ad-free, and built on proven formulas. Used by trainers and athletes worldwide.`

**Ad 2 — Strength / 1RM:**

- Headline 1: `One Rep Max Calculator -- Free`
- Headline 2: `Strength Standards by Age & Weight`
- Headline 3: `Used by 10,000+ Lifters`
- Description: `Calculate your 1RM using Epley, Brzycki, or Lombardi formulas. Compare your lifts to strength standards. Clean interface, no ads. Powered by GymGurus.`

**Ad 3 — TDEE / Nutrition:**

- Headline 1: `TDEE Calculator -- Free & Accurate`
- Headline 2: `Know Your Daily Calorie Needs`
- Headline 3: `Macro Calculator Included`
- Description: `Calculate your Total Daily Energy Expenditure with our free tool. Includes macro breakdown and calorie targets. Built for trainers and clients.`

**Daily Budget:** $3-5/day (roughly $90-150/month). This campaign is a long-term brand play, not a direct-response play.

### 1.3 Display Remarketing Campaign

**Campaign Name:** `google_display_remarketing`
**Objective:** Re-engage users who visited the GymGurus site (especially calculator pages and the homepage) but did not sign up. Keep the brand top-of-mind and drive return visits.

| Signup Abandoners     | Started signup flow but did not complete | 7 days          | 50 - 150            | Critical |

### 1.4 Performance Max Campaign (Consideration)

**Campaign Name:** `google_pmax_gymgurus`
**Status:** Evaluate after 60 days of Search + Remarketing data.

**What Performance Max Does:**
Performance Max (PMax) is Google's AI-driven campaign type that runs across Search, Display, YouTube, Gmail, Discover, and Maps simultaneously. It uses machine learning to optimize placements, bidding, and creative combinations.

**When to Launch PMax:**

- After accumulating 30+ conversions from Search and Display campaigns (Google needs conversion data to optimize PMax effectively).
- When monthly budget reaches $1,000+ (PMax performs poorly with very small budgets).
- Estimated launch: Month 3 of paid advertising (Phase 2 budget).

**PMax Asset Groups:**

| Asset Type               | Requirement                          | GymGurus Assets                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Long Headlines (up to 5) | 5 variations, 90 chars max           | "The AI-Powered Platform Built for Independent Personal Trainers", "Manage Clients, AI Coach, 12 Calculators -- All for $49/mo Flat"                                                    |
| Descriptions (up to 5)   | 5 variations, 90 chars max           | "Built-in AI coach, gamification, and 12 pro calculators. Modern UI your clients will love.", "Save 5+ hours/week on admin. AI handles routine client questions. Free trial available." |
| Images                   | 3+ landscape, 3+ square, 1+ portrait | Product screenshots (dashboard, AI coach, calculators), lifestyle images of trainers                                                                                                    |
| Videos                   | 1+ (YouTube hosted)                  | 30-second product demo, 15-second calculator highlight                                                                                                                                  |
| Final URL                | Primary landing page                 | `gymgurus.com/lp/trainer`                                                                                                                                                               |
| Audience Signals         | Suggested audiences for Google's AI  | Custom segments: "personal trainer software" searchers; Remarketing lists; Customer list (beta users)                                                                                   |

**PMax Budget:** Allocate 30-40% of total Google Ads budget once launched ($300-400/month at Phase 2 budget).

**Risks:**

- PMax is a black box -- limited visibility into which placements and keywords drive results.
- Can cannibalize brand search traffic if not configured with brand exclusions.
- Requires sufficient conversion volume to optimize effectively.

**Mitigation:**

- Set up brand exclusions to prevent PMax from bidding on "GymGurus" branded terms.
- Monitor Search Terms report weekly (available since 2024 PMax update).
- Run PMax alongside existing Search campaigns, not as a replacement.

## 2. Meta Ads Strategy (Facebook / Instagram)

Meta Ads are the primary channel for awareness and mid-funnel engagement. Fitness professionals are highly active on Instagram, and Facebook Groups are where trainers discuss business tools. Meta's targeting allows precise audience definition based on professional interests and certifications.

### 2.1 Interest Targeting: Fitness Professionals

**Objective:** Reach personal trainers and fitness coaches who have not yet heard of GymGurus.
**Optimization Event:** Lead (email capture) or Signup (account creation).

### 2.2 Lookalike Audience Strategy

**Prerequisite:** A source audience of at least 100 email addresses (beta users + waitlist signups). Larger source lists produce better lookalikes.

| Lookalike Audience             | Source                                      | Lookalike % | Est. Size (US) | Use Case                                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **LAL -- Email List 1%**       | Customer email list (beta users + waitlist) | 1%          | ~2.3M          | Highest quality. Use for conversion-optimized campaigns.                              |
| **LAL -- Email List 3%**       | Customer email list                         | 3%          | ~6.9M          | Broader reach. Use for awareness campaigns.                                           |
| **LAL -- Website Visitors 1%** | Meta Pixel: All website visitors (30 days)  | 1%          | ~2.3M          | Good quality after 1,000+ pixel fires. Launch Month 2.                                |
| **LAL -- Calculator Users 1%** | Meta Pixel: Calculator page visitors        | 1%          | ~2.3M          | Fitness-aware audience. Launch when calculator traffic reaches 500+ monthly visitors. |
| **LAL -- Signups 1%**          | Meta Pixel: Signup completion event         | 1%          | ~2.3M          | Best performing lookalike. Requires 100+ signup events. Launch Month 3.               |
| **LAL -- Video Viewers 1%**    | People who watched 75%+ of video ads        | 1%          | ~2.3M          | Engaged audience. Launch after first video campaign.                                  |

**Lookalike Strategy by Phase:**

- **Phase 1 (Month 1):** LAL from email list only (1% and 3%). This is the only lookalike available before significant pixel data accumulates.
- **Phase 2 (Month 2-3):** Add website visitor and calculator user lookalikes as pixel data matures.
- **Phase 3 (Month 3+):** Add signup-based lookalike (highest value). Test stacking lookalikes for broader reach.

**Important:** Always exclude the source audience from lookalike targeting to avoid overlap. Also exclude all other active audiences to prevent cross-campaign bid competition.

### 2.3 Video Ad Creative Concepts

Video is the highest-performing format on Meta platforms. These three concepts cover different angles -- product demo, pain point, and social proof -- and should be A/B tested against each other.

#### Video Concept 1: "The 5-Hour Problem" (Pain Point)

**Format:** 30-second vertical video (9:16) for Instagram Reels and Facebook Reels
**Hook (first 3 seconds):** Text overlay on dark background: "You didn't become a trainer to do admin work."
**Target Audience:** Interest-based (fitness professionals) and lookalikes

**Script:**

```
[0-3 sec] TEXT ON SCREEN: "You didn't become a trainer to do admin work."
Dark background. White text. No audio yet.

[3-7 sec] VOICEOVER: "If you're a personal trainer spending 5 hours a week
on spreadsheets, client messages, and programming..."
VISUAL: Quick montage -- spreadsheet chaos, phone buzzing with client texts,
trainer looking overwhelmed at a desk.

[7-12 sec] VOICEOVER: "...there's a better way."
VISUAL: Transition to GymGurus dashboard. Clean, dark UI. Smooth scroll
through client list. Electric Blue (#3B82F6) accents pop.

[12-18 sec] VOICEOVER: "GymGurus is an AI-powered platform that manages your
clients, answers their questions with a built-in AI coach, and keeps them
engaged with gamification."
VISUAL: Quick cuts -- AI coach chat interface, client earning XP,
calculator being used, workout template being created.

[18-24 sec] VOICEOVER: "Twelve pro calculators. AI coaching. Client management.
All for forty-nine dollars a month flat."
VISUAL: Feature icons animate in. Price appears: "$49/mo" in Emerald (#10B981).
"No per-client fees" appears below.

[24-30 sec] VOICEOVER: "Try GymGurus free. Link in bio."
VISUAL: GymGurus logo on dark background. CTA button animates:
"Start Free Trial" in Electric Blue. URL: gymgurus.com
```

**Thumbnail:** Dark background, trainer at desk looking overwhelmed, text overlay: "5 hours/week on admin?"

---

#### Video Concept 2: "Meet Your AI Coach" (Product Demo)

**Format:** 45-second vertical video (9:16) for Instagram Reels and Facebook Feed
**Hook (first 3 seconds):** Screen recording of AI coach chat with text: "This AI coach answers your clients' questions 24/7."
**Target Audience:** Lookalike audiences and retargeting (site visitors)

**Script:**

```
[0-3 sec] TEXT ON SCREEN: "What if your clients had a coach available 24/7?"
Screen recording of AI coach interface starts in background.

[3-10 sec] VOICEOVER: "Meet the GymGurus AI Coach. It answers your clients'
questions about form, nutrition, programming, and recovery -- so you don't
have to repeat yourself twenty times a day."
VISUAL: Screen recording -- a client types "What's the correct form for
Romanian deadlifts?" and the AI responds with a detailed, accurate answer.

[10-18 sec] VOICEOVER: "It's trained on exercise science and works inside
the platform your clients already use."
VISUAL: Screen recording -- another question: "How many calories should I
eat on rest days?" AI provides a personalized answer referencing the client's
TDEE calculation.

[18-28 sec] VOICEOVER: "But it's not just an AI chatbot. GymGurus gives you
a full client management dashboard, workout programming tools, progress
tracking, and twelve built-in fitness calculators."
VISUAL: Quick dashboard tour -- client cards, workout builder, progress
charts, calculator grid. All in the dark premium UI with Electric Blue
and Emerald accents.

[28-38 sec] VOICEOVER: "Your clients earn XP for completing workouts.
Streaks keep them accountable. Achievements keep them motivated.
You get a smarter business. They get a better experience."
VISUAL: Gamification elements -- XP animation, streak counter, achievement
badge unlocking. Client view of their progress dashboard.

[38-45 sec] VOICEOVER: "GymGurus. Forty-nine dollars a month. No per-client fees.
Start your free trial today."
VISUAL: Logo + CTA. "$49/mo flat" in Emerald. "Free Trial" button in
Electric Blue. URL: gymgurus.com
```

#### Video Concept 3: "The Switch" (Social Proof / Testimonial)

**Format:** 60-second vertical video (9:16) for Instagram Reels, Facebook Feed, and Facebook Reels
**Hook (first 3 seconds):** Beta trainer on camera: "I was paying $99 a month for TrueCoach and still doing half the work manually."
**Target Audience:** Competitor keyword audiences, interest-based, and retargeting

**Script:**

```
[0-3 sec] TRAINER ON CAMERA: "I was paying ninety-nine dollars a month for
TrueCoach and still doing half the work manually."
Setting: Gym or home office. Natural lighting. Casual, authentic feel.

[3-12 sec] TRAINER: "I heard about GymGurus from another trainer in a
Facebook group. I was skeptical because it was new. But the AI coach
thing caught my attention -- I spend way too much time answering the
same client questions over and over."
VISUAL: Trainer talking directly to camera. B-roll cuts of phone
notifications, typing responses to clients.

[12-22 sec] TRAINER: "I signed up for the free trial and within a day I had
my clients set up. The AI coach started handling the routine questions --
form checks, nutrition basics, 'what should I do on rest days.' The
gamification thing was a surprise hit -- my clients actually started
completing their workouts more consistently because they didn't want
to break their streaks."
VISUAL: Screen recording of GymGurus -- client setup, AI coach in action,
client earning XP. Mixed with trainer talking to camera.

[22-35 sec] TRAINER: "The calculator tools are great for onboarding new
clients. I run them through the BMI calculator, the strength standards,
and the TDEE calculator in our first session. It makes me look professional
and it's all built into the platform."
VISUAL: Calculator tools being used. Trainer showing a client their phone
with the results.

[35-48 sec] TRAINER: "I switched fully after the first week. I'm saving
fifty dollars a month and honestly getting more out of the platform.
The dashboard is cleaner, the AI is a genuine time saver, and my
clients actually enjoy using it."
VISUAL: Trainer on camera. Confident. B-roll of the GymGurus dashboard.

[48-60 sec] TRAINER: "If you're a trainer still cobbling together
spreadsheets and overpriced software, just try it. The free trial
is no-risk."
TEXT ON SCREEN: "GymGurus -- $49/mo flat. No per-client fees.
Free trial at gymgurus.com"
VISUAL: Logo + CTA with Electric Blue button.
```

**Thumbnail:** Trainer on camera with text overlay: "I switched from TrueCoach. Here's what happened."

### 2.4 Instagram Reels Ad Format

Instagram Reels ads are served natively in the Reels feed and are the highest-engagement paid format on Instagram in 2026. All three video concepts above are designed for the 9:16 vertical format required by Reels.

**Reels Ad Specifications:**

| Specification | Requirement                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Aspect Ratio  | 9:16 (vertical)                                                          |
| Resolution    | 1080 x 1920 minimum                                                      |
| Duration      | 15-60 seconds (30 seconds optimal)                                       |
| File Format   | MP4 or MOV                                                               |
| Max File Size | 4 GB                                                                     |
| Captions      | Required (85% of Reels are watched without sound)                        |
| Safe Zones    | Keep text and CTAs within center 80% (top/bottom cropped by UI elements) |

**Reels-Specific Creative Guidelines:**

1. **Hook in the first 1.5 seconds.** Reels autoplay -- users decide to stop or scroll within the first frame. Open with motion, bold text, or an unexpected statement.
2. **Design for sound-off.** Use text overlays and captions for the entire video. The voiceover is a bonus, not a requirement.
3. **Native aesthetic.** Reels ads that look like organic content outperform polished, corporate-looking ads by 2-3x. Use natural lighting, handheld camera feel, and conversational tone.
4. **End with a clear CTA.** The last 3 seconds should include the CTA text and a compelling reason to act ("Free trial -- no credit card").
5. **Use trending audio cautiously.** Trending sounds boost organic reach but may not be licensable for paid ads. Use original audio or royalty-free music.

**Reels Ad Rotation Plan:**

| Week     | Primary Creative                | Secondary Creative              | Objective                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Week 1-2 | Concept 1: "The 5-Hour Problem" | Concept 2: "Meet Your AI Coach" | Test hooks and audience response |
| Week 3-4 | Winner from Week 1-2            | Concept 3: "The Switch"         | Test testimonial format          |
| Month 2+ | Top performer + 1 new variation | Refresh losing creative         | Optimize and prevent fatigue     |

## 3. Budget Allocation & ROI Targets

### Phase 1: $500/Month Starting Budget

The initial $500/month budget is designed to test channels, gather conversion data, and identify the highest-ROI campaigns before scaling.

**Budget Allocation:**

| Channel        | Campaign                         | Monthly Budget | % of Total | Rationale                                           |

| **Google Ads** | Search: Calculator Keywords      | $50            | 10%        | Low CPC, brand awareness, remarketing pool builder. |
| **Google Ads** | Display: Remarketing             | $50            | 10%        | Re-engage warm visitors at low cost.                |
| **Meta Ads**   | Interest Targeting: Fitness Pros | $125           | 25%        | Awareness and top-of-funnel lead gen.               |

### Expected CPA Targets by Channel

| Channel / Campaign                 | Target CPA (Signup)      | Target CPA (Paid Conversion) | Rationale                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Google Search: Trainer Software    | $20 - $35                | $80 - $120                   | High intent, direct response. Expect 5-8% of signups to convert to paid.                 |
| Google Search: Calculator Keywords | $5 - $10 (email capture) | N/A (awareness)              | Low CPC, high volume. Goal is email capture and remarketing, not direct paid conversion. |
| Google Display: Remarketing        | $10 - $20                | $50 - $80                    | Warm audience, lower CPA than cold traffic.                                              |
| Meta: Interest Targeting           | $15 - $25                | $70 - $100                   | Cold audience, but precisely targeted.                                                   |
| Meta: Lookalike Audiences          | $12 - $20                | $60 - $90                    | Statistically similar to existing users. Better than cold interest targeting.            |
| Meta: Retargeting                  | $8 - $15                 | $40 - $60                    | Warmest audience. Highest conversion rate across all channels.                           |

## 4. UTM Standards & Tracking

Consistent UTM parameters are critical for accurate attribution in GA4. Every paid link must include UTMs. No exceptions.

### UTM Naming Convention

| Parameter      | Format                                          | Description                  | Example                                                                          |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `utm_source`   | Platform name (lowercase)                       | Where the traffic comes from | `google`, `facebook`, `instagram`, `linkedin`, `tiktok`, `youtube`, `email`      |
| `utm_medium`   | Channel type (lowercase)                        | How the traffic is delivered | `cpc`, `display`, `social`, `email`, `video`, `retargeting`                      |
| `utm_campaign` | `{goal}_{audience}_{date}` (lowercase, hyphens) | Campaign identifier          | `signup_trainer-software_2026q1`, `awareness_calculator-traffic_2026q1`          |
| `utm_content`  | Ad creative identifier (lowercase, hyphens)     | Which ad variation           | `ad1-ai-forward`, `ad2-price-forward`, `video-5hr-problem`, `banner-728x90-calc` |
| `utm_term`     | Keyword or audience segment                     | What triggered the ad        | `personal-trainer-software`, `nasm-certified`, `lal-email-1pct`                  |

**Rules:**

- All lowercase. No spaces. Use hyphens (`-`) as word separators, underscores (`_`) as field separators.
- Date format in campaigns: `2026q1` (quarterly), `2026m02` (monthly), or `2026w07` (weekly) depending on campaign duration.
- Every ad variation gets a unique `utm_content` value.
- Every keyword or audience segment gets a unique `utm_term` value.

### Example UTMs for Each Campaign Type

**Google Search -- Trainer Software:**

```

### GA4 Conversion Tracking Setup

**Step 1: Define Conversion Events**

| Event Name            | Trigger                                             | Conversion Value          | Priority  |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------- |
| `signup_start`        | User clicks "Sign Up" or "Start Free Trial" button  | $0                        | Secondary |
| `signup_complete`     | User completes account registration                 | $5 (estimated lead value) | Primary   |
| `onboarding_complete` | User finishes all onboarding steps                  | $10                       | Primary   |
| `first_client_added`  | Trainer adds their first client                     | $15                       | Primary   |
| `trial_to_paid`       | User upgrades from free to paid plan                | $49 or $99 (actual value) | Primary   |
| `calculator_use`      | User completes a calculation on any calculator page | $0.50 (micro-conversion)  | Secondary |
| `email_capture`       | User submits email on any lead capture form         | $2                        | Secondary |

**Step 2: Configure GA4**

1. Navigate to GA4 Admin > Events > Mark the above events as conversions.
2. Assign monetary values to each conversion event using the values above.
3. Enable Enhanced Measurement for scroll depth, outbound clicks, and site search.
4. Connect Google Ads account to GA4 for automated conversion import.
5. Set up Audiences in GA4 that mirror the remarketing audiences defined in Section 1.3.

**Step 3: Configure Meta Pixel**

1. Install Meta Pixel base code on all pages (if not already installed).
2. Set up Standard Events:
   - `Lead` -- fires on `email_capture`
   - `CompleteRegistration` -- fires on `signup_complete`
   - `Subscribe` -- fires on `trial_to_paid`
   - `ViewContent` -- fires on calculator page views
3. Set up Custom Events:
   - `CalculatorUse` -- fires when a user completes a calculation
   - `OnboardingComplete` -- fires on onboarding completion
4. Verify all events in Meta Events Manager > Test Events tool.

**Step 4: Cross-Platform Attribution**

- Use GA4's default "Data-driven attribution" model (replaced last-click as default in 2024).
- Review the GA4 Advertising > Attribution > Model Comparison report monthly to understand how channels work together.
- For Meta-specific attribution, compare Meta Ads Manager's 7-day click / 1-day view window against GA4's attribution to identify discrepancies.
- Maintain a monthly attribution reconciliation spreadsheet comparing GA4 conversions vs. platform-reported conversions for each channel.

## 6. Scaling Plan

### 3-Month Budget Scaling: $500 -> $1,000 -> $2,000

The scaling plan follows a data-driven approach: spend conservatively in Month 1 to identify winning channels, increase budget to winning campaigns in Month 2, and scale aggressively in Month 3 while introducing new channels.

### Month 1: $500/month -- Test & Learn

**Objective:** Gather baseline data. Identify which campaigns, audiences, and creatives perform best. Establish CPA benchmarks.

| Channel    | Budget | Campaigns Active                                                       | Key Actions                                                                  |
| ---------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Google Ads | $250   | Search (trainer software), Search (calculators), Display (remarketing) | Launch all 3 campaigns. Test 3 ad copy variations each. Set manual CPC bids. |
| Meta Ads   | $250   | Interest targeting, Lookalike (email 1%), Retargeting                  | Launch all 3 ad sets. Test all 3 video concepts. Monitor cost per result.    |

**End-of-Month Review Checklist:**

- [ ] Which Google keyword has the lowest CPA?
- [ ] Which Meta audience has the lowest CPA?
- [ ] Which video creative has the highest completion rate and lowest CPA?
- [ ] What is the actual CPC vs. estimated CPC for each keyword?
- [ ] How large is the remarketing pool (site visitors)?
- [ ] How many email captures from calculator traffic?
- [ ] Are conversion tracking events firing correctly in GA4 and Meta Pixel?

**Decision Framework:**

- If a campaign's CPA is 2x above target after $100 spend and 1,000+ impressions: pause and reallocate budget.
- If a campaign's CPA is at or below target: increase daily budget by 20%.
- If a creative has <1% CTR after 2,000 impressions: replace with a new variation.

---

### Month 2: $1,000/month -- Double Down on Winners

**Objective:** Scale winning campaigns from Month 1. Introduce Performance Max (if conversion threshold met). Test new creative angles.

| Channel    | Budget | Changes from Month 1                                                                                                              |
| ---------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Google Ads | $500   | 2x budget on best-performing search keywords. Launch PMax if 30+ conversions recorded. Expand remarketing audiences.              |
| Meta Ads   | $500   | 2x budget on best-performing audience/creative combo. Launch new lookalike (website visitors 1%). Test 2 new creative variations. |

**New Initiatives:**

- Launch Google Performance Max campaign ($150-200 of Google budget) if conversion threshold is met.
- Create new Meta lookalike audience from website visitors (requires 1,000+ pixel fires).
- Produce 2 new video ad variations: iterate on the winning concept from Month 1 with a fresh hook.
- Begin A/B testing landing page headlines (test 2 headline variations on `/lp/trainer`).

**Budget Reallocation Rules:**

- Shift budget from underperforming channels to overperforming channels (up to 70/30 split).
- If Google outperforms Meta: allocate $600 Google / $400 Meta.
- If Meta outperforms Google: allocate $400 Google / $600 Meta.
- Never fully pause a channel -- maintain at least $200/month per platform for data continuity.

---

### Month 3: $2,000/month -- Scale & Diversify

**Objective:** Aggressively scale proven campaigns. Introduce new platforms (LinkedIn, YouTube) for testing. Begin building creative production cadence.

| Channel      | Budget | Changes from Month 2                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------ | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Google Ads   | $900   | Scale best search campaigns. Full PMax launch with video assets. Expand to additional calculator keywords.                                               |
| Meta Ads     | $800   | Scale best audience/creative combos. Launch signup-based lookalike (1%). Introduce carousel ad format.                                                   |
| New Channels | $300   | LinkedIn Ads ($150): Test interest targeting for fitness professionals. YouTube Ads ($150): Run 15-second pre-roll using best-performing video creative. |

**New Initiatives:**

- Launch LinkedIn Sponsored Content campaign targeting "Personal Trainer" and "Fitness Coach" job titles ($150/month test).
- Launch YouTube in-stream ads (skippable, 15-second cut of best video) targeting fitness-related channels ($150/month test).
- Produce a dedicated 15-second YouTube pre-roll ad optimized for the skip-or-watch decision at 5 seconds.
- Create 3 new static ad variations for Google Display based on Month 1-2 performance data.
- Begin weekly creative refresh cycle: replace lowest-performing ad creative every Monday.

**Month 3 Expected Results (based on Month 1-2 optimization):**

| Metric                | Conservative  | Moderate      | Aggressive    |
| --------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Monthly Spend         | $2,000        | $2,000        | $2,000        |
| Signups (free + paid) | 60 - 80       | 80 - 120      | 120 - 180     |
| Paid Conversions      | 6 - 10        | 10 - 18       | 18 - 30       |
| Blended CPA (Signup)  | $17 - $25     | $12 - $20     | $8 - $14      |
| Blended CPA (Paid)    | $200 - $333   | $111 - $200   | $67 - $111    |
| ROAS (Month 3 only)   | 0.15x - 0.25x | 0.25x - 0.45x | 0.45x - 0.75x |

**Note on ROAS:** Month 3 ROAS appears low because it only measures immediate paid conversions. The true ROI is realized over the customer lifetime (11.3 months average). A $200 CPA against a $692 Net LTV yields a 3.5:1 lifetime ROAS -- well above the 3:1 threshold.

### Beyond Month 3: Scaling Framework

Once the $2,000/month budget is optimized, scaling follows this framework:

| Monthly Budget    | When to Scale                                    | How to Scale                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $2,000 -> $3,000  | CPA is 20%+ below target for 2 consecutive weeks | Increase daily budgets on winning campaigns by 20-30%. Do not change targeting or creative.                                     |
| $3,000 -> $5,000  | CPA remains stable after first budget increase   | Introduce new audience segments (broader lookalikes, new interest targeting). Launch on one additional platform.                |
| $5,000 -> $10,000 | CAC payback period is under 3 months             | Scale all proven campaigns. Hire a part-time media buyer or agency. Begin brand awareness campaigns (non-conversion-optimized). |
| $10,000+          | MRR exceeds $15,000 and LTV:CAC is above 4:1     | Full-funnel advertising. Influencer partnerships. Podcast sponsorships. Event marketing.                                        |

**Scaling Rule:** Never increase budget by more than 30% in a single week. Large budget jumps disrupt platform algorithms and inflate CPAs. Gradual increases allow the algorithm to adapt.
